# Conclusion
In this lesson, we've explored how to use Python to load and visualize data from a `.csv` file using two different types of plots: **histograms** and **scatter plots**. By writing flexible, reusable functions, we were able to automate our analysis and create visualizations that highlight different aspects of our data.

Histograms are best for answering questions like:

* Which values occur the most frequently? 

* What is the overall shape of the data distribution?

* Are there any outliers or skew in the data?

While other plot types (like scatter plots, line graphs, or bar charts) are more suited for answering questions like:

* How do individual data points relate to an independant variable (time, position, channel)?

* Where do significant changes or features occur in the data?
